##Marketing Research Team

As a marketing research team member, I will be presented with the data of clicks from the app that is provided to the focus group. The data will be utilized by my team to create a highly effective market analysis. This market analysis will also be used to direct the developer into creating Bus Mall overall.

##The Developer

As a developer, I will initiate the research with creating the app that will be a survey for assessing popularity of possible products to be offered by BusMall. I will create the app to gauge the clicks from the focus group to provide the date for the market research team to utilize for effective marketing. 

##Focus Group Participant

As a focus group participant, I will play an important role in what items will be featured in Bus Mall. I will be utilizing the app that will display the products to me (three at a time), and from there I will be chosing my favorite products by clicking on their favorite. Each click will collectively accumulate into figures from all participants in order to gauge popularity.
